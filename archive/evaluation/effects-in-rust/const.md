# Compile-time Execution (Scoped Effect)
## Description

The `const` keyword marks functions as "is allowed to be evaluated during
compilation". When used in scope position its meaning changes slightly to: "this
_will_ be evaluated during compilation". There is no way to declare "must be
evaluated at compilation" functions, causing the meaning of "const" to be
context-dependent.

|                                   | declaration          | usage                         |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **keyword never applies**         | `fn meow() {}`       | `fn hello() { meow() }`       |
| **keyword always applies**        | -                    | `const CAT: () = {};`         |
| **keyword conditionally applies** | `const fn meow() {}` | `const fn hello() { meow() }` |

## Feature Status

The `const` feature is integrated in a lot of the stdlib and ecosystem already,
but it's notoriously missing any form of const-traits. Because a lot of Rust's
language features make use of traits, this means const contexts have no access
to iteration, `Drop` handlers, closures, and more.

## Feature categorization

| Position    | Syntax                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Effect      | `const fn`                     |
| Yield       | N/A                            |
| Apply       | automatic                      |
| Consume     | `const {}`, `const X: Ty = {}` |
| Reification | N/A                            |
