# keyword generics initiative
<!--

 This is the template for creating an initiative in rust-lang. Be sure to go
 through all sections marked with `**FIX ME**`, and make sure that the text is
 correct, and feel free to replace/remove any part that's not relevant to
 your group.

 Steps to customize:

 * Edit CHARTER.md
 * Replace placeholder text (see below)
 * Remove references to "expermental" and "evaluation" unless you need them
 
  All of the text across all of the initial files uses the same group of
 variables to allow for easy search and replace. They are listed below.

 Example sed command: `sed -i '' 's/keyword generics/Inline ASM/g' ./**/*.md`
 *Note* you need `-i ''` on macOS and just `-i` on Linux.

 * keyword generics -> The display name of your group e.g. "Inline ASM".
 * keyword-generics-initiative -> The url slug name of your group used for
   `rust-lang/team` and repo name. e.g. "pg-inline-asm".
 * Zulip -> The name of your chat app e.g. "Zulip".
 * {{CHAT_LINK}} -> The hyperlink to your discussions on the chat app
   e.g. "https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/216763-project-inline-asm".

To get your repo under rust-lang, file an infra issue:

## What is this?

This page tracks the work of the keyword generics [initiative]! To learn more

## Current status

The following table lists of the stages of an initiative, along with links to the artifacts that will be produced during that stage.
