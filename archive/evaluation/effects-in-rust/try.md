| Modifier            | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Option<T>`         | Used to describe optional values                      |
| `Result<T, E>`      | Used to describe errors or success values             |
| `ControlFlow<B, C>` | Used to represent control-flow loops                  |
| `Poll<T>`           | Used to describe the state of `Future` state machines |

While the reification of the fallibility effect in bounds ought to be `impl
Try`, it more commonly is the case that we see concrete types used.

## Feature categorization

| Position    | Syntax                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Effect      | `try`                   |
| Yield       | `throw`                 |
| Apply       | `?`                     |
| Consume     | `match` / `fn main()` † |
| Reification | `impl Try`              |

> † `fn main` implements effect polymorphism over the fallibility effect
> by making use of the [`Termination` trait]. It stands to reason that _if_ we
> had a `try` notation for functions, that it should be possible to write
> `try fn main` which desugars to a `Result` type being returned.
