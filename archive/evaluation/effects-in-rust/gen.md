# Iteration (Scoped Effect)

## Feature Status

The `Iterator` trait has been stable in Rust since 1.0, but the generator syntax
is currently _unstable_. This document will assume that generators are created
with the `gen` keyword, but that's for illustrative purposes only.

## Technical Overview

| Position    | Syntax          |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Effect      | `gen`           |
| Yield       | `yield`         |
| Apply       | N/A             |
| Consume     | `for..in`       |
| Reification | `impl Iterator` |

## Refinements

| Modifier      | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| step          | Has a notion of successor and predecessor operations. |
| trusted len † | Reports an accurate length using `size_hint`.         |
| trusted step  | Upholds all invariants of `Step`.                     |
| double-ended  | Is able to yield elements from both ends.             |
| exact size †  | Knows its exact length.                               |
| fused         | Always continues to yield `None` when exhausted.      |

> † The difference between `TrustedLen` and `ExactSizeIterator` is that
>  `TrustedLen` is marked as `unsafe` to implement while `ExactSizeIterator` is
>  marked as _safe_ to implement. This means that if `TrustedLen` is implemented,
>  you can rely on it for safety purposes, while with `ExactSizeIterator` you
>  cannot.

| Description                    | Creates an iterator of futures. The future takes the iterator by `&mut self`, so only a single future may be executed concurrently |
| Example                        | [`AsyncIterator`][ai]                                                                                                              |
| Implementable as of Rust 1.70? | No, async functions in traits are unstable                                                                                         |
